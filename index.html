				<h2>Impact Mapping</h2>
				<p>A collaborative strategic planning technique</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Context</h2>
					<p>The technology world need an approach that engages DEV organisations as full partner's with other
						disciplines</p>
					<p>EU companies lost 142B Euros on failed IT projects in just one year (2014), like the cost of the
						international space station programm</p>
					<p>Some Reasons: Poor alignment with business objectives, business strategies becoming obsolete
						during IT project delivery</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Root Causes of IT failed projects</h2>
					<p>Wrong business assumptions</p>
					<p>Lack of focus on the business goal</p>
					<p>Poor communication of objectives</p>
					<p>Lack of business understanding</p>
					<p>Misalignment with overall goals</p>

					<h2>What is impact mapping?</h2>
					<p>A method for collaborative strategic planning</p>
					<p>It provides guidance to help organisations make an impact on software</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Benefits of impact mapping?</h2>
					<p>+ Better plans and product roadmaps</p>
					<p>+ Clear communication of assumptions</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Impact Map</h2>
					<p>Definition: A visualisation of scope and underlying assumptions</p>
					<p>Answer questions: Why?, Who?, How?, What?</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why?</h2>
					<p>The goal we are trying to achieve</p>
					<p>A goal is the explanation why such a thing would be useful</p>
					<p>Definition of problem to be solved, not the solution</p>
					<p>Knowing why we are doing something is the key to make good decisions about cost, scope and
						timelines</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Benefits of clear goal communication?</h2>
					<p>Everyone knows why they are doing something</p>
					<p>It helps teams to align their activities better</p>
					<p>It helps identify true requirements and design better solutions</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Samples</h2>
					<p>Starting to trade in Brazil by March next year</p>
					<p>Increasing user conversion rate by 20% in 3 months</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Who?</h2>
					<p>The involved actors</p>
					<p>Who can produce the desired effect to achieve the goal?</p>
					<p>Who can obstruct the goal?</p>
					<p>Who are the consumer of our products and who will be impacted by our goal?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Identify actors</h2>
					<p>Thinking about decision-makers, user groups and customer segments</p>
					<p>Considering primary actors first</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Samples</h2>
					<p>Paul Red from the marketing department</p>
					<p>Under 18 users with a mobile device</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>How?</h2>
					<p>The expected impacts</p>
					<p>How should our actors behaviour change?</p>
					<p>Actors behaviour are impacts</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Samples</h2>
					<p>Inviting more friends</p>
					<p>Selling tickets faster</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>What?</h2>
					<p>The deliverables</p>
					<p>What can we do to support the required impact?</p>
					<p>Treat deliverables as options with no much details</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Samples</h2>
					<p>on-line ticket sales</p>
					<p>mobile home page with purchase form</p>

					<h2>Usage of Impact Map</h2>
					<p>Advise: Use impact map to find the shortest path through the map to the goal</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sample of Impact Map</h2>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits of Impact Map</h2>
					<p>+ Communicate assumptions</p>
					<p>+ Create plans</p>
					<p>+ Align stakeholders</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Apply Impact Map to strategic planning</h2>
					<p>You need strategic goals - impact mapping is not applicable to maintenance mode projects</p>
					<p>You need the partecipation of senior decision-makers and senior technical staff</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Apply Impact Map to define quality</h2>
					<p>You need agreement that the purpose of deliverables is to support changes in actor behaviour</p>
					<p>You need agreement on metrics that express stakeholders expectations</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Apply Impact Map to roadmap management</h2>
					<p>You need agreement that your aim is to achieve a business goal, not deliver pre-set scope</p>
					<p>You need frequent, iterative releases to measure progress</p>
					<p>You need agreement on metrics that express stakeholders expectations for the central business
						goal</p>
				</section>

					<h2>How impact maps can solve common problems?</h2>
					<p>Benefits of clear mapping from deliverables to goals</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We can measure when the main objective is reached and stop working on it</li>
						<li>Clear view of all planned software features that support an impact</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Benefits of having software deliverables in the context of business goals</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Easy to spot solutions looking for a problem</li>
						<li>Easy to spot over-complicated solutions</li>
						<li>Prevent over-engineering</li>
						<li>Helps to discard more complex solutions</li>
						<li>Easy to spot features taht do not support any of the desired activities (they don't fit in
							the map visually)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<h2>Ad-Hoc Prioritisation</h2>
					<p>Why IT projects fail</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Business reasons</li>
						<li>Business strategy superseded</li>
						<li>Poor alignment</li>
						<li>Poor requirements management</li>
						<li>Business benefits not clearly communicated</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						The idea of goal oriented requirements practices is to focus projects
						on supporting usage goals and behaviour impacts instead of
						pre-set features or tasks
					</p>
					<p>
						Berkrun used simple mapping between goals, features and requirements
						to prevent scope creep during the development of the Excel program at Microsoft
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Impact maps instead of just connecting features to goals at the start
						of a product milestone or a project, it allow us to maintain a dynamic
						roadmap that changes with our learning, keeping the goal in mind and making
						features and scope secondary to it.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						We visualise assumptions that allow us to change direction once
						these assumptions are proven or discarded
					</p>
					<p>
						By mapping deliverables to a business goal, impact maps strengthen
						the case for limiting the number of business goals and impacts
						we worth on at any given time, according with the limited work in progress
						from lean development methods.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Business Goal should be SMART:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Specific</li>
						<li>Measurable</li>
						<li>Action-oriented</li>
						<li>Realistic</li>
						<li>Timely</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Adaptive Planning</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Intentionally testing assumptions (validated testing)</li>
						<li>Build-measure-learn cycle</li>
						<li>Lean startup approach</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Iterative Delivery</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Iterative delivery versus incremental</li>
						<li>A common way teams fail with iterative delivery is to incrementally deliver
							pieces that only bring value when they come together at the end
						</li>
						<li>Impact maps break deliverables down into branches that contribute
							to individual impacts helping us decide about quick ways to support them
							promoting iterative delivery
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>User Stories</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Impact mapping prevents "Story card hell" allowing to capture
							stakeholder needs as actor behaviour impacts
						</li>
						<li>Once we start working on an impact we can grow the scope
						</li>
						<li>Instead of hundreds of stories we can work with a map of
							dozen stories at a time
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>User Story and impact mapping Sample</p>
					<p>
						As a Partner {WHO?}
						I want automated invites {HOW?}
						So that I can invite friends {WHAT?}
